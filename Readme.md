Colab notebooks for the computational statistics lecture that I will be teaching in 2022 - 2023 Fall semester at TED university.

Important Note: I usually do live coding during the lectures. Therefore there may be some grammatical errors in the comments, since I usually add explanatory comments in pretty quick and dirty way. Please consider this.
